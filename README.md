# BREXIT-ENGLAND

A Quantitative Data Analysis of the 2016 EU Referendum Result

1.	Introduction

A referendum was held on June 23, 2016 on the UK’s membership of the European Union which resulted in the UK electorate voting to leave the EU by 51.9% to 48.1%. Despite many of the polls in the run-up to the referendum that predicted a win for remain (NatCen Social Research 2016), vote leave won by a margin of 3.78%. The aim of this paper is to identify the socio-economic variables that most explain the leave vote by building a predictor model. However, the reader should bear in mind that this analysis is based on only England’s Local authority data and does not represent Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales. It is also difficult to make inference to the UK wide population as the data is not randomly selected.
