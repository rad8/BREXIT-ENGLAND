Who are the Leave Voters?
A Quantitative Data Analysis of the 2016 EU Referendum

1.	Introduction

A referendum was held on June 23, 2016 on the UK’s membership of the European Union which resulted in the UK electorate voting to leave the EU by 51.9% to 48.1%. Despite many of the polls in the run-up to the referendum that predicted a win for remain (NatCen Social Research 2016), vote leave won by a margin of 3.78%. Why did the British vote to leave the EU? Since the referendum, a number of articles and research papers have been published seeking to explain the leave vote. Specifically, Becker, S., et.al (2017) revealed that the social and economic characteristics of the population explained the leave vote more than exposure to the EU either through migration or trade. In this paper, I will use aggregate level quantitative data analysis techniques in order to support their view. Hence, the aim of this paper is to identify those variables that most explain the leave vote by building a predictor model. However, the reader should bear in mind that this analysis is based on only England’s Local authority data and does not represent Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales. It is also difficult to make inference to the UK wide population as the data is not randomly selected.
